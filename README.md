# Note Taking App made in Flutter with Sqlite database 
 This is a note taking app made with flutter.<br>
## Features:
<ul>
<li>Sqlite database to store custom Note object.</li>
<li>Search Functionality</li>
<li>Staggered GridView</li>
</ul>


## Requirements:

- Create a form to add new notes with the following fields: title, content, and category.
- Store notes in a local database such as SQLite or Moor.
- Implement a List View to display all notes, sorted by date created (newest to oldest).
- Each item in the List View should display the note's title and category.
- Allow users to edit and delete existing notes by tapping on them.
- Implement a search feature that allows users to search for notes by title or category.
- Add a dropdown or chip filter to allow users to filter notes by category.
- Use a state management solution such as Provider or Bloc to manage the app's state.

## Bonus points:

- Add the ability to add images to notes and display them in the ListView.
- Implement a login and authentication system so that notes are only visible to authenticated users.
- Implement synchronization with a remote server using Firebase or a similar service so that notes can be accessed from multiple devices.
- Implement a dark mode and light mode theme switcher.

The source code is **100% Dart**.
